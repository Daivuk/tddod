Other tower defense examples using EnTT exist. This one was only built for learning experience also for a talk I gave at work for a Lunch n Learn, also for TechSphere Ottawa.

## Repository structure
* `assets/` Game content loaded at runtime. CMake will copy this into your build folder.

* `contentProcessor/` Node.js script to generate data.h to be consumed by the game. Run this if you will to modify the map or waves data.

* `src/` Game source files.

* `thirdparty/` Various thirdparty libraries and submodules used by this project.

* `visualizer/` Tool to visualize Tags/Systems/Components and see which uses which.

## How to build
```
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
On windows, open the solution, build and run.
On linux or mac, do:
```
make
./tddod
```

## The ruleset for this project
- Components are struct only. No complex type and no logic.
- Systems are single function only.
- Helper functions are used to create complex entity types (Factories) or to perform eventful actions.
